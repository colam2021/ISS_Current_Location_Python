# International Space Station
 According to Open Notify, the ISS is moving at close to 28,000 km/h around the globe.  The project's objective is to locate the current location of ISS.   
 I came across this Python project for beginners from a Python learning channel on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CCTuHast0).  To learners, the goal of the project is to learn Python by doing.
